    "text": "I’m a Frontend Developer with 6 years of experience building fast, clean, and scalable web applications. My expertise spans Angular, React, and Vue, and I’ve worked on projects with more than 500k users, delivering secure, high-performance, and user-focused interfaces.\n\nI love turning complex ideas into intuitive, responsive UI systems and enjoy working in modern frontend ecosystems—TypeScript, state management, testing, micro-frontends, and clean architecture. Over the years, I’ve improved legacy codebases, migrated large Angular projects to Vue, and significantly optimized performance and developer workflows.\n\nBefore transitioning fully into frontend engineering, I worked in IT infrastructure, which gives me a strong understanding of systems, networking, and cloud environments—skills that help me collaborate effectively across teams and build more robust web applications.\n\nI’m passionate about high-quality code, great UX, and continuous learning, and I enjoy mentoring other developers on their journey."
